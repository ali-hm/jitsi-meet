# A Fork of Jitsi Meet - Secure, Simple and Scalable Video Conferences

Jitsi Meet is an open-source (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript application that uses [Jitsi Videobridge](https://jitsi.org/videobridge) to provide high quality, [secure](https://jitsi.org/security) and scalable video conferences. Jitsi Meet in action can be seen at [here at the session #482 of the VoIP Users Conference](http://youtu.be/7vFUVClsNh0).

The Jitsi Meet client runs in your browser, without installing anything else on your computer. You can try it out at https://meet.jit.si.

Jitsi Meet allows very efficient collaboration. Users can stream their desktop or only some windows. It also supports shared document editing with Etherpad.

## Installation

On the client side, no installation is necessary. You just point your browser to the URL of your deployment. This section is about installing a Jitsi Meet suite on your server and hosting your own conferencing service.

Installing Jitsi Meet is a simple experience. For Debian-based system, following the [quick install](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-quickstart) document, which uses the package system. You can also see a demonstration of the process in [this tutorial video](https://jitsi.org/tutorial).

For other systems, or if you wish to install all components manually, see the [detailed manual installation instructions](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-manual).

Installation with Docker is also available. Please see the [instruction](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-docker).
